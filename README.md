I am Joshua Carney, a junior Computer Science student at Millersville University in Lancaster, PA. Through multiple video game creation projects in both my education and through online game jams, I have a proficiency with the Unity game engine as well as many of the general facets of game design. This experience in Unity has given me a knowledge with object oriented programming and design, primarily through C#, but also through formal education in several courses pertaining to data structures and algorithms. When I'm not programming, I enjoy hobbies such as making music and operating sound boards for community and school theater.
