I am Joshua Carney, a junior Computer Science student at Millersville University in Lancaster, PA. Through multiple video game creation projects in both my education and through online game jams, I have a proficiency with the Unity game engine as well as many of the general facets of game design. This experience in Unity has given me a knowledge of object oriented programming and design, primarily in C#, but also through formal education in several courses pertaining to data structures and algorithms. When I'm not programming, I enjoy hobbies such as making music and operating sound boards for community and school theater. 

Check out some of my repos below to see some of the games and projects I've helped created over the years, as well as my course work for several courses.
