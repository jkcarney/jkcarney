Hello! My name is Joshua Carney, and I am a senior Computer Science student at Millersville University in Lancaster, PA. Through multiple video game creation projects in both my education and through online game jams, I have a proficiency with the Unity game engine as well as many of the general facets of game design. This experience in Unity has given me a knowledge of object oriented programming and design, primarily in C#, but also through formal education in several courses pertaining to data structures and algorithms. 

During the summer of 2021, I interned at Bentley Systems Inc. on the Developer Infrastruture team. There I did tasks, primarily in ASP.NET Core, updating existing full-stack systems and APIs to support company wide git management systems with active directory. I also wrote scripts in Python to automate group membership utilizing these APIs and log relevant information. I also developed a brand new token management system for API access to various internal services. I developed both the API and GUI components for the system in ASP.NET Core, which gave me a good experience in full stack development.

One of my most used tools is the Unity Engine. I've partcipated in many projects created in Unity, both through my education and through popular "game jams" such as the GMTK Game Jam. In my game design/game programming class, I developed three games in 3 different teams. Two of said games received some of the highest marks out of all projects produced over the course of the semester. Along with my brothers I have also participated in multiple online game jams, one of the biggest ones being the GMTK Game Jam 2020, where we placed in the top 2% overall out of over 5500 entries.

When I'm not programming, I enjoy hobbies such as making music and operating sound equipment for community and school theater. 

Check out some of my repos below to see some of the games and projects I've helped created over the years, as well as my course work for several courses.
